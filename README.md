# Handmade Hero

This is my implementation of the game "Handmade Hero" by Casey Muratori. The project is written in C++ and uses SDL2 for graphics and input handling. Besides the handmade hero playlist, I'm also following David Gow's [Handmade Penguin](https://davidgow.net/handmadepenguin) guide for linux specific implementations.
